# New Secondary Fund Aims to Capitalize on VC’s Liquidity Crunch

Released July 10, 2025

Good day. Venture-capital firms have struggled to return capital to investors over the past several years with public listings drying up and M&A activity sputtering. A new fund aims to capitalize on this liquidity crunch.

Scenic Management, a late-stage, private growth equity investment manager, has raised a $150 million sophomore fund, doubling down on its strategy to purchase shares of private companies from early-stage venture firms and senior-level employees. Scenic Management has also raised a variety of co-investment special-purpose vehicles.

The demand for the fund reflects the relative lack of exits in the past few years, Scenic Management co-founder and President Mike Sobel said. That market dynamic has created opportunity in the so-called secondary market, where shares of private companies can be traded before a potential initial public offering or acquisition.

San Francisco-based Scenic tapped institutional investors, family offices and wealthy individuals to raise the fund, called Scenic Private Access Fund II. Scenic will deploy the fund over two years and is aiming to return capital to its investors within five years, which would provide investors with a shorter exit timeline than is typical for private investments, Sobel said. Roughly 20% of the fund will be used to make direct equity investments in companies, Sobel added.
