# Kognitos and qBotica Partner to Bring English as Code to the Enterprise for Key Operational Needs

Released July 17, 2025

New partnership targets unmet needs in enterprise automation empowering business users to generate, deploy and govern enterprise-grade automations in conversational English and finally solve the “brittle bot” problem.

SAN JOSE, Calif. & PHOENIX–Kognitos, the pioneer of neurosymbolic AI for business automation, and qBotica, a leader in AI and intelligent automation services, today announced a strategic partnership to deliver the next generation of enterprise automation. The collaboration directly addresses the critical shortcomings of current automation platforms like agentic process automation (APA) and robotic process automation (RPA), offering a hallucination-free solution that empowers business users to drive automation using plain English, accelerating their business and eliminating the gap between IT and business.

Many enterprises today face challenges with legacy automation platforms that are expensive to maintain, require specialized developers and create brittle bots that break with any process change. This partnership provides a direct path for these companies to upgrade their automation capabilities. qBotica, with its deep expertise in business process automation using platforms like UiPath, is now delivering the next generation of automation using Kognitos’ leading neurosymbolic AI platform.

The joint offering empowers enterprises to:

- Self-refine automation:Utilize Kognitos’ patented Process Refinement Engine for self-healing automations that automatically adapt to business changes.

- Use English as code:Finally, business users and IT can speak the language that the automation engine understands. The enterprise accelerates when there is no need for translation of business logic into automation logic. Documentation in English drives the automation.

- Ensure enterprise-grade governance:Turn tribal knowledge into transparent, self-documented workflows that are easily audited and fully governable, eliminating “black box” AI risks.

- Drastically reduce development and maintenance costs:Shorten automation development cycles by up to 90% and consolidate expensive automation tools into a single, unified platform.

“Our clients have experienced the power of automation but want to take advantage of AI’s most dynamic and agile capabilities,” said Mahesh Vinayagam, founder and CEO of qBotica. “Having implemented complex automation solutions for years, we recognize that Kognitos represents a fundamental shift. Through English as code, we can finally empower business users with proximity and visibility to the automations that serve their needs. We’re not just offering a new tool; we’re providing our clients a strategic upgrade to a more intelligent, resilient, and cost-effective automation model.”

Binny Gill, founder and CEO of Kognitos, added: “The promise of AI in the enterprise cannot be realized with opaque, unreliable technology. We built Kognitos with a neurosymbolic architecture to be hallucination-free and completely auditable, where English documentation is enterprise-grade automation that any business user can review. Partnering with qBotica is strategic; their proven expertise in migrating and managing large-scale automation programs makes them the ideal partner to help organizations seamlessly transition from brittle bots or hallucinating AI to the deterministic AI execution model of Kognitos.”
