## Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the foundational architecture of the Kognitos platform?

The Kognitos platform is built on a neurosymbolic AI architecture, unifying the deterministic reasoning of symbolic logic with the adaptive learning capabilities of modern AI. This design ensures robust governance, eliminates AI hallucinations by design, and provides a unified platform for automating diverse back-office processes.

## How does "neurosymbolic AI" enhance enterprise business automation and ensure reliability?

Neurosymbolic AI is critical because it ensures processes are followed precisely and transparently, mitigating the unpredictable behaviors often associated with traditional black-box AI. By combining symbolic reasoning with neural networks, Kognitos delivers non-hallucinating AI agents that understand and meticulously follow business operations, providing the predictability and control vital for enterprise-grade automation.

## What technical mechanisms does Kognitos employ to prevent AI hallucinations?

Kognitos prevents AI hallucinations through its cutting-edge neurosymbolic architecture that was built to follow process. Kognitos ensures that automated processes adhere strictly to defined logic and continuously learn from human interactions, eliminating deviations and providing robust AI governance and control by design.

## How does Kognitos differ from traditional automation tools like RPA?

Unlike traditional RPA, which relies on brittle, script-based bots susceptible to environmental changes, Kognitos uses English as code to establish a dynamic, AI-refined system of record for business operations. This approach ensures 10x lower maintenance costs and 10x faster time to value by providing flexible, self-optimizing automations with built-in regression testing, moving beyond mere task automation to truly transforming tribal and system knowledge into documented processes.

## What constitutes a "dynamic system of record", and what are its technical implications?

A “dynamic system of record” refers to Kognitos’s ability to transform your teams’ knowledge into documented, AI-refined automations, creating a continuously updated and optimized repository of business processes. This system offers full auditability, explainability, and is kept current through patented process refinement.

## What coding languages are needed to build automations with Kognitos?

None. Kognitos uses English as code, allowing business users to automate in minutes while maintaining IT oversight. While technical teams will appreciate the underlying neurosymbolic architecture and robust governance, the platform’s intuitive interface reduces reliance on specialized coding skills, enabling broader adoption and accelerating time to value across the enterprise.

## How does Kognitos handle exceptions in automated processes?

Kognitos manages exceptions through its integrated Guidance Center and patented process refinement methodology. Any deviation from a standard process triggers a request for human guidance, which is then learned by the system for continuous optimization. This ensures that the automated processes remain robust and adaptable and reduces manual intervention over time.

## How does Kognitos integrate with my company's existing systems and data?

Kognitos is a unified platform designed for broad use cases and tech stack consolidation. It supports both structured data through native integrations with hundreds of enterprise applications and unstructured data from emails, documents, images, and more. For legacy apps without APIs, we provide browser automation to ensure full interoperability.

## What do you mean by a "dynamic system of record?"

Kognitos turns your undocumented “tribal knowledge” and disparate system information into documented, automated workflows. This creates a living, auditable system of record for how work gets done. Our patented process refinement dynamically learns from human interaction to keep processes optimized and aligned with business evolution.

## How can I get started with Kognitos?

You can get started today by either reaching out to our enterprise sales team for a demo or by exploring the Kognitos Platform Community Edition. It’s free to sign up, and you can take an idea from concept to a functioning automation in as little as five minutes using English as code.
