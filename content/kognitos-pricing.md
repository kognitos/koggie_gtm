# Kognitos Pricing

## Automation Where English Is the Code

Kognitos is the only automation platform where you describe what you want in plain language—and our AI agents build, run, and maintain it with you. The result isn't just automation. It's institutional memory: a system that knows how your business works and gets smarter with every transaction.

## How Pricing Works

**You pay for automation capacity. Everything else is included.**

We believe the teams who build and maintain your automations shouldn't be limited by seat licenses. That's why builders, resolvers, and our AI agents are all unlimited. You simply choose a capacity tier based on how much automation you need to run.

### What You Pay For

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Automation Capacity** | Monthly credits that power your automations. Different processes consume different resources—credits are the common currency that scales with your needs. |
| **Extended Audit Trail** | Standard plans include 1 year of searchable decision history. Regulated industries can extend this for compliance requirements. |

---

## Capacity Tiers

| Tier | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Growth** | Teams starting their automation journey |
| **Scale** | Departments with established processes |
| **Enterprise** | Organization-wide automation programs |
| **Unlimited** | High-volume, mission-critical operations |

Unused credits roll over when you renew at the same tier or higher.
