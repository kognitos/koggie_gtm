# Kognitos Website Copy 2026 — Revised
*Framework: AIDA + Objection Handling + CRO Best Practices*

---

## 1. Hero Section (Attention)

**Headline:**  
Hallucination-Free AI That Remembers How Your Business Works

**Sub-headline:**  
Other platforms automate tasks. Kognitos captures expertise. Every automation becomes living documentation. Every exception becomes a runbook. Build a system that learns—and never forgets.

**Primary CTA:** Book a Demo  
**Secondary CTA:** See How It Works (2 min)

**Micro-commitment below CTA:**  
*No technical skills required. See results in your first conversation.*

---

## 2. Trust Bar (Social Proof)

**Section Header:**  
Trusted by Teams Who Can't Afford to Guess

**Trust Caption:**  
Global enterprises run mission-critical processes on Kognitos—because when AI hallucinates, operations stop. These teams chose the only platform where English is the code and accuracy is guaranteed.

**Elements:**
- Customer logos (6-8)
- Integration logos row
- "1M+ automations executed" or similar proof point

---

## 3. Problem Agitation (Stir the Pain)

**Section Header:**  
Your Automation Is Bleeding Expertise

**Three-column layout:**

| The SOP Graveyard | The Tribal Knowledge Exit | The Exception Black Hole |
|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Your SOPs live in wikis nobody reads. The moment you automate, documentation goes stale. When processes change, nobody updates the manual. | Your best people know how things *really* work. When they leave, that knowledge walks out the door. No documentation. No playbook. Just scrambling. | Exceptions pile up. Each one gets solved—then forgotten. Next month, someone solves the same problem from scratch. The wheel keeps getting reinvented. |

**Transition line:**  
*What if your automation WAS your documentation—and every fix became permanent knowledge?*

---

## 4. Solution Introduction (Interest)

**Section Header:**  
Two AI Engines. One Institutional Memory.

**Sub-header:**  
Kognitos doesn't just run your processes. It captures how your business works—and gets smarter every day.

**Two-column feature layout:**

### Builder Agent — For Builders
*Turns English into automation*

Describe your process in plain language. Builder Agent builds, tests, and refines it through conversation. No code. No drag-and-drop. Just English.

**What you get:**
- Living SOPs that never go stale
- 10x faster development than RPA
- Automations your business users can actually read and maintain

**CTA:** See Builder Agent →

---

### Resolution Agent — For Resolvers
*Turns exceptions into expertise*

When something unexpected happens, Resolution Agent explains what went wrong and helps your team resolve it. Then it writes the runbook—automatically.

**What you get:**
- Runbooks that capture tribal knowledge forever
- 90% of future exceptions auto-resolved
- A system that learns from every incident

**CTA:** See Resolution Agent →

---

## 5. The Outcome Grid (Desire)

**Section Header:**  
What Changes When AI Doesn't Forget

**2x2 Grid:**

### Living Documentation
**Your automation IS your SOP.**  
No more stale wikis. No more "how does this work again?" Every process is documented in plain English—and it updates itself when the process changes.

### Tribal Knowledge—Captured
**Expertise stays when employees leave.**  
Every exception resolution becomes a permanent runbook. The knowledge that used to live in people's heads now lives in your system.

### 90% Auto-Resolution
**Exceptions that solve themselves.**  
Resolution Agent applies existing runbooks to new exceptions automatically. Your team only handles what's truly new.

### Audit Trail That Makes Sense
**Compliance teams can actually read it.**  
Every decision, every value, every exception—recorded in English. Not log files. Not code traces. Readable audit history.

## 6. How It Works (Technical Credibility — Keep It Brief)

**Section Header:**  
Hallucination-Free by Design

**Sub-header:**  
We separated "thinking" from "doing" so your business rules execute with 100% predictability.

**Three columns:**

| English as Source Code | Neurosymbolic Architecture | Self-Healing Runtime |
|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Business logic lives in plain English. Your team owns it, reads it, changes it. No black boxes. | Neural reasoning handles ambiguity. Symbolic execution guarantees accuracy. Zero hallucination on deterministic rules. | When the world changes, the system doesn't crash—it asks. Patch logic at runtime without restarting. |

**Proof point:**  
*12x lower maintenance than traditional automation platforms.*

**CTA:** Read the Technical Deep-Dive →

## 7. The "No Lock-In" Promise (Objection Handling)

**Section Header:**  
Your Knowledge Is Yours. Always.

**Copy:**  
We don't win by trapping you. Export your automations, your runbooks, your audit trail—anytime, for free. 

The real switching cost isn't a fee. It's leaving a system that knows how your business works and gets smarter every day.

**We believe:** If we're not delivering value, you should be able to leave. That's why knowledge export is always free.

**Trust badges:** SOC 2 | GDPR | Your Data Stays Yours

---

## 8. Who It's For (Segmentation)

**Section Header:**  
Built for Teams Who Move Fast and Can't Afford Mistakes

**Three personas:**

### Operations Leaders
"I need processes that run without babysitting—and documentation that doesn't rot."
→ Living SOPs that update themselves

### IT & Automation Teams  
"I'm drowning in maintenance and exception queues."
→ 90% auto-resolution + 12x lower maintenance

### Compliance & Risk
"I need audit trails I can actually defend."
→ Plain-English decision history, searchable and exportable

---

## 9. Pricing Transparency (Objection Handling)

**Section Header:**  
Simple Pricing. No Surprises.

**Copy:**  
You pay for execution and builder capacity. Everything else is included.

| You Pay For | Included—Unlimited |
|-------------|-------------------|

# CRO Notes for Design/Dev

1. **Hero CTA:** High contrast, above the fold, visible without scrolling
2. **Sticky CTA:** "Book a Demo" stays visible on scroll
3. **Social proof early:** Trust bar immediately after hero reduces bounce
4. **Problem before solution:** Section 3 creates urgency before introducing product
5. **Specificity builds trust:** Named engines (Builder Agent, Resolution Agent) feel more real than generic "AI"
6. **Numbers over adjectives:** "10x faster" beats "much faster"
7. **Objection handling embedded:** "No lock-in" and "Resolvers are free" answer skepticism before it forms
8. **Multiple CTAs:** Primary (demo) and secondary (lower commitment) at each decision point
9. **Risk reversal at final CTA:** "30-minute call, no commitment" reduces friction
10. **Exit intent popup:** Offer "See How [Company] Automated [Process]" case study PDF
