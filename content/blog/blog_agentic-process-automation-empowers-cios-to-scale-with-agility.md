### Key Takeaways

Agentic Process Automation provides CIOs with the tools to build a truly scalable and agile enterprise.

- How it works: Unlike traditional automation that is rigid and slow to change, AI agents can be developed and deployed rapidly using natural language. The serverless architecture also scales seamlessly with transaction volumes.

- The business impact: This allows the business to respond quickly to new opportunities or challenges without needing to manually provision infrastructure.

- The key benefit: It delivers an operational backbone that is not only efficient but also highly adaptable to changing business needs.

## Organizations Need to Scale with Agility

Agility and the ability to scale operations quickly are critical priorities for any large organization. As the market rapidly evolves and grows more competitive, scalability and agility enable organizations to pivot swiftly in response to changes in the economy, customer demands, and available resources. CIOs must support not just the IT department, but the entire organization by building highly scalable systems that support business expansion while maintaining performance and efficiency.

According to a Gartner report,74% of CEOsbelieve AI is the technology that will have the most impact and influence on their industries. As a result, CIOs are under constant pressure to demonstrate value and tangible business impact from their AI investments. As CIOs look to meet lofty expectations,agentic process automation(APA) is poised to finally deliver on the elusive promise of agile and scalable enterprise automation.

## Limited Scalability of Legacy Automation Solutions

Automation has been on the radar of enterprise organizations since the early 2000s in an attempt to streamline workflows and improve operational efficiency. As process automation evolved, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solutions emerged. While RPA offered some benefits as compared to previous Business Process Management (BPM) solutions, itfaced challenges in scalability and agilitydue to its limitations in handling complex processes, frequent breakdowns leading to high maintenance costs, and ever-increasing direct costs.

APA solutions employ a serverless infrastructure, capable of scaling to the organization’s needs without the same infrastructure and skilled talent investments that make RPA untenable at scale.

AI agents make intelligent decisions based on your organization’s standard operating procedures, allowing for more agile and responsive operations (e.g., 24/7 support). Unlike RPA, APA can adapt to changing conditions without the classic software development lifecycle headaches, ensuring that business processes remain optimized even as variables fluctuate.

APA solutions are also capable of executing multiple tasks simultaneously instead of one after the other (serial), which accelerates process execution times and significantly improves productivity.

### Too Many Point Solutions

One of the biggest challenges organizations face in scaling operations is the fact that they currently employ too many point solutions—specialized software tools designed to address a specific problem. Large enterprises used an average of112 SaaS applications in 2023and new data suggests that this number is only continuing to increase. Point solutions undermine organizational agility. They are difficult to integrate and are a leading contributor to technical debt—a challenge cited by91% of CTOs.

Agentic process automation can integrate seamlessly with various existing tools and platforms, learning from enterprise data to provide highly contextualized, end-to-end process automation. Furthermore, since APA is AI-native, it comes with a plethora of built-in skills that eliminate the need for many point solutions entirely. This is why many leading technologists, including Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, say that theend of SaaS may have already begun.

APA solutions come with minimal friction in terms of adoption, applicability, and infrastructure, empowering CIOs to replace point solutions and drive scalability.

### High Costs of Scaling Legacy Systems

Legacy systems, particularly on-premise installations, continue to constrain organizational scalability and agility in the modern era. While RPA and similar technologies have provided temporary relief by integrating with modern, cloud-based tools, they do not address the core limitations of legacy systems, which often tether organizations to outdated infrastructure.

APA offers a comprehensive solution that bridges legacy systems with cutting-edge AI technology. This not only facilitates smoother integration, but also provides CIOs with a practical pathway to phase out legacy systems in favor of serverless, cloud-native solutions.

Unlike legacy systems that require significant maintenance and hardware investments, APA solutions are inherently scalable. They can dynamically handle increases in workload without corresponding increases in operational costs, making them ideal for organizations seeking scalability and cost-efficiency.

### The Talent and Skills Gap

59% CIOs admittedthat staffing and skills shortages detract from time spent on strategic initiatives. This struggle has become a major hindrance for organizations, as existing talent lacks the skills to automate with incumbent solutions and requires support from larger maintenance teams to automate additional processes.

Agentic solutions bridge skills gaps by augmenting human capabilities instead of replacing headcount. Automating routine, non-strategic tasks frees employees’ bandwidth to focus on work requiring critical thinking and decision-making. AI agents deployed by APA solutions are capable of providing users with contextual information, simplifying process automation. This helps organizations avoid investing heavily in specialized human resources.

## The Way Forward

Agentic process automation is a powerful tool helping CIOs overcome scalability and agility challenges. It provides infinite scalability, process optimization, end-to-end workflow automation, run parallelization, and autonomous decision making. CIOs leveraging AI automation can enhance operational efficiency and drive strategic growth, moving from a cost center to a revenue generator in their organizations.
