# Kognitos Global Privacy Notice

Kognitos, Inc., headquartered in the U.S., is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who interact with us, such as our website visitors, customers, business partners, leads and prospects, recipients of marketing communications, end users and event attendees (“you” and “your”). This Privacy Notice generally explains the different ways in which Kognitos collects, uses and shares personal information.

## KOGNITOS PRIVACY NOTICE

Last Updated: October 10, 2024

This Privacy Notice explains how Kognitos, Inc., (“Kognitos”) collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes personal data in connection with our websites, includinghttps://www.kognitos.com, and other websites we own and operate that link to this Privacy Notice (collectively, the “Sites”), and the related content, platform, services, products, and other functionality offered on or through our services (collectively, the “Services”).  We may also choose or be required by law to provide different or additional disclosures relating to the processing of personal data about residents of certain countries, regions, or states.

This Privacy Notice does not address our privacy practices relating to Kognitos’ employees and other employment-related individuals, nor data that is not subject to applicable data protection laws (such as deidentified or publicly available information). This Privacy Notice is also not a contract and does not create any legal rights or obligations not otherwise provided by law.

## Our Role in Processing Personal Data

Data protection laws sometimes differentiate between “controllers” and “processors” of personal data. A “controller” determines the purposes and means (the why and how) of processing personal data. A “processor,” which is sometimes referred to as a “service provider,” processes personal data on behalf of a controller subject to the controller’s instructions.

This Privacy Notice describes our privacy practices where we are acting as the controller of personal data. However, this Privacy Notice does not cover or address how our customers may process personal data when they use our services, or how we may process personal data on their behalf in accordance with their instructions where we are acting as their processor. As a result, we recommend referring to the privacy notice of the customer with which you have a relationship for information on how they engage processors, like us, to process personal data on their behalf. In addition, we are generally not permitted to respond to individual requests relating to personal data we process on behalf of our customers, so we recommend directing any requests to the relevant customer.

## Our Collection and Use of Personal Data

The categories of personal data we collect depend on how you interact with us and our services. For example, you may provide us your personal data directly when you sign up for our mailing list, register for an account, subscribe to our services, post a review, participate in an event, or otherwise contact us or interact with us.

We also collect personal data automatically when you interact with our websites and other services and may also collect personal data from other sources and third parties.

## Personal Data Provided by Individuals

We collect the following categories of personal data individuals provide us:

- Contact Information,including first and last name, phone number, email address, mailing address, and communication preferences. We use this information primarily to fulfill your request or transaction, to communicate with you directly, and to send you marketing communications in accordance with your preferences.

- Account Information, including first and last name, business contact information (e.g., email address, phone number), account credentials or one-time passcodes, and the products or services you are interested in, purchased, or have otherwise used. We use this information primarily to administer your account, provide you with our products and services, communicate with you regarding your account and your use of our products and services, and for customer support purposes.

- Customer Content, including any files, documents, audio, videos, images, data, or communications you choose to input, upload, or transmit to our products and services, or through any third-party integrations.

- Employment Application Information, including your contact and demographic information, educational and work history, employment interests, information obtained during interviews and any other information you choose to provide, if you apply for employment.

If you choose to contact us, we may need additional information to fulfill the request or respond to your inquiry. We may provide additional privacy disclosures where the scope of the request we receive or personal data we require fall outside the scope of this Privacy Notice. In that case, the additional privacy disclosures will govern how we may process the information you provide at that time.

## Personal Data Automatically Collected

We, and our third-party partners, automatically collect information you provide to us and information about how you access and use our products and services when you engage with us. We typically collect this information through the use of a variety of our own and our third-party partners’ automatic data collection technologies, including (i) cookies or small data files that are stored on an individual’s computer and (ii) other, related technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, mobile SDKs, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies.

- Information About Your Device and Network, including the device type, manufacturer, and model, operating system, IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, and unique identifiers associated with you, your device, or your network (including, for example, a persistent device identifier or advertising ID).

These third-party technologies may also record information you enter when you interact with our products or services, or engage in chat features or other communication platforms we provide.

- Information About Your Location, including general geographic location that we or our third-party providers may derive from your IP address.

All of the information collected automatically through these tools allows us to improve your customer experience. For example, we may use this information to enhance and personalize your user experience, to monitor and improve our products and services, to offer communications features such as live and automated chat, and to improve the effectiveness of our products, services, offers, advertising, communications and customer service.  We may also use this information to:  (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted content and advertising; (c) identify you across multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our services; (e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our website; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (g) otherwise to plan for and enhance our products and services.

We do not have any control over these third-party tools and features and are not responsible if they do not function as intended.

## Targeted Advertising Preferences

We engage third parties to help us facilitate targeted advertising designed to show you personalized ads based on predictions of your preferences and interests developed using personal data we maintain and personal data our third-party partners obtain from your activity over time and across nonaffiliated websites and other services. The data we and our third-party partners use for purposes of facilitating targeted advertising, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research, are primarily collected through the use of a variety of automatic data collection technologies, including cookies, web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, mobile SDKs, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies. We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) with our third-party advertising partners to help link the personal data we and our third-party partners collect to the same person, or otherwise target advertising to an individual on a third-party website or platform.

In addition to taking the steps set forth in theAutomatic Data Collection Preferencessection above, you may be able to further exercise control over the advertisements that you see by leveraging one or more targeted advertising opt-out programs. For example:

- Device-Specific Opt-Out Programs: Certain devices provide individuals the option to turn off targeted advertising for the entire device (such as Apple devices through their App Tracking Transparency framework or Android devices through their opt out of ads personalization feature). Please refer to your device manufacturer’s user guides for additional information about implementing any available device-specific targeted advertising opt-outs.

Please refer to your platform provider’s user guides for additional information about implementing any available platform-specific targeted advertising opt-outs.

Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements through one of these programs, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our services.  Instead, it means that the online ads you do see from relevant program participants should not be based on your interests.  We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, program participants may still use automatic data collection technologies to collect information about your use of our services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the applicable advertising industry program.
