# Webinars – Automating the 4-Way Match in SAP with Kognitos

Is your procure-to-pay process slowed down by the sheer complexity of manual 4-way matching in SAP? The constant need to verify purchase orders, goods receipts, invoices, and certificates of analysis is a critical, yet painfully inefficient, safeguard against quality failures and fraud. It’s time to move beyond the limitations of traditional automation and empower your team to work smarter, not harder.
