### Key Takeaways

AI-powered automation unlocks true return on investment (ROI) by tackling the massive hidden costs of traditional RPA.

- How it unlocks ROI: By using natural language, it drastically reduces development costs by empowering business users. Its resilient, API-first nature minimizes the constant maintenance burden of brittle bots.

- The business impact: The ROI extends beyond direct cost savings to benefits like improved compliance, enhanced customer satisfaction, and the creation of a “corporate memory.”

- The key model: A consumption-based pricing model further aligns investment with outcomes, ensuring companies pay for value delivered.

Enterprise organizations are constantly seeking ways to optimize operations and improve their return on investment (ROI). Kognitos helps companies achieve incredible returns by both consolidating costs and creating opportunities for top-line growth. By addressing the inefficiencies of legacy robotic process automation (RPA) and other forms of automation, while aligning investments with outcomes, Kognitos delivers superior value, agility, and productivity.

## Direct Savings: The Financial Advantage

One of the clearest ways Kognitos delivers ROI is through direct cost savings. Many legacy RPA solutions come with high implementation and maintenance costs, including consulting fees, infrastructure investments, and ongoing payroll for RPA developers. With Kognitos, these costs are significantly reduced or removed from the equation entirely.

1. Lower Development CostsA $20,000 RPA bot and license can easily lead to an additional $120,000 or more in annual costs related to development, specialized consultants, or outsourced firms. Kognitos’ AI-driven platform eliminates the need for external consultants and developers by creating processes in plain English, reducing complexity and speeding up time to production.

2. Reduce Infrastructure CostsTraditional RPA systems require substantial infrastructure to operate, including servers, maintenance contracts, software licensing, and testing environments. Kognitos’ cloud-based, scalable architecture and use of APIs eliminates infrastructure expenses, further driving down total cost of ownership.

3. Alleviate Pressure on Workforce ShortagesKognitos supplements the need for full-time-employees by automating routine, manual tasks, allowing companies to repurpose their workforce to focus on higher-value activities such as problem-solving and innovation. This reduction in the need for operational headcount translates into significant cost savings over time.

4. Reduce Costly Churn and Improve Employee SatisfactionWhen processes are automated, employees are paid on time and routine tasks are completed without delays. This reduces the need for emergency hires or the stress of the hire-and-fire cycle, improving employee satisfaction and reducing HR costs associated with churn, recruiting, and training.

5. Eliminate DowntimeErrors in business processes can have significant financial impacts, ranging from compliance fines to lost revenue. Kognitos eliminates downtime by automating processes with precision, ensuring greater accuracy and reliability. Kognitos-powered processes don’t break when they meet exceptions. Instead, they pause to await human intervention, allowing unaffected process runs to continue uninterrupted.

6. Reduction of Technical Debt and Vendor ConsolidationWith fewer applications to manage, organizations reduce their technical debt, which eases the burden on IT teams. Kognitos’ flexible platform handles multiple automation needs, from document processing to system auditability, allowing for vendor consolidation by minimizing the need for costly additional third-party tools.

## Indirect Savings: Beyond the Bottom Line

While direct savings from cost reductions are important, Kognitos also delivers substantial indirect savings, which further amplify its ROI potential.

1. Boost Customer SatisfactionFailing to meet SLAs can lead to strained vendor relationships and lost customers, both of which can have a ripple effect on a company’s reputation and bottom line. Kognitos helps organizations meet their SLAs consistently by automating processes at scale with higher accuracy, reducing associated penalties and improving customer satisfaction

2. Avoid Integration NightmaresIn fast-paced industries like finance or retail, companies often face integration challenges, especially during mergers and acquisitions. Kognitos helps streamline these processes by automating the integration of business systems ensuring continuity across different platforms.

3. Create Corporate MemoryKognitos helps organizations build a valuable “corporate memory” by documenting, standardizing, and storing business processes reducing the cost of disruptions when key employees leave or change roles. Companies can avoid steep learning curves and process slowdowns that often occur with employee churn, contributing to long-term cost savings.

4. Improved ComplianceThe built-in auditability of processes run on Kognitos helps organizations stay compliant in highly regulated industries like banking and healthcare. This control and visibility can help organizations to reduce the risk of potential fines or legal issues that can hurt a company’s bottom line and negatively impact the share price.

## Supporting Top-Line Growth

ROI isn’t just about reducing costs—it’s also about driving revenue growth. Kognitos supports top-line growth in several ways:

1. Customer and Vendor ExpansionBy automating processes that impact both customers and vendors, Kognitos ensures that payments are timely, services are delivered accurately, and communication is seamless. Happy customers and vendors are more likely to remain loyal or even expand their services, increasing customer retention rates and strengthening vendor relationships. This, in turn, drives repeat business and supports long-term revenue growth.

2. Market Perception and Strategic AdvantagesIn today’s market, companies leveraging AI and automation have a competitive advantage. Kognitos enables organizations to market themselves as cutting-edge and forward-thinking, which can boost shareholder confidence and improve market perception. This can lead to new business opportunities, enhanced market share, and, ultimately, greater revenue.

3. Faster Decision-MakingAI automation allows businesses to make faster, more informed decisions. By eliminating manual work and reducing the risk of human error, Kognitos ensures that companies can act quickly and accurately on important data.

### Aligning Investments with ROI

Unlike traditional RPA platforms that lock customers into expensive licensing agreements and come with a myriad of indirect costs, Kognitos offers a consumption-based pricing model that aligns customer investments directly to ROI.

Costs are directly tied to outcomes, because companies only pay for what they use. This removes the financial risk associated with traditional RPA platforms, where companies might invest heavily upfront without knowing whether they’ll see a return.

Customers can start small, automating a few key processes, and then scale their automation efforts as they prove ROI. This flexibility allows companies to grow their investment in support of their business goals, ensuring that the platform delivers maximum value. The more organizations invest in automating their processes, the more they stand to gain in terms of cost savings and revenue growth.

## ROI Impact with Kognitos

Kognitos is revolutionizing the way organizations approach automation by delivering direct cost savings, indirect benefits, and top-line growth opportunities. Its consumption-based pricing model ensures that investments are aligned with business outcomes, giving organizations the flexibility and scalability they need to thrive in a competitive market. As companies increasingly look to adopt AI and automation, Kognitos offers a compelling solution that drives long-term ROI and positions them for success in the digital age.
