Our client, one of the world’s largest multinational food and beverage companies, operates in over 200 countries with more than 250 production facilities and a workforce of 280,000 employees. The company was committed to reducing operational costs and enhancing customer experience. They faced significant challenges with their ticket management system in ServiceNow, which relied on a third-party service to interpret and manually assign tickets to appropriate internal departments. This process was costly and slow, with tickets being received in multiple languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, and English.

Additionally, Kognitos reviewed their popular global rewards program that allowed customers to submit a photo proof of purchase to earn rewards. This process was inefficient and required manual review of up to 2 million receipts each year to mitigate fraudulent submissions.

To address these issues, the company partnered with Kognitos, which leveraged GPT technology to automate the interpretation and assignment ofServiceNowtickets. Kognitos implemented a solution that runs continuously, 24/7, 365 days a year. The platform utilized a custom endpoint to seamlessly update ticket data, ensuring that service requests were directed to the correct departments immediately upon receipt, regardless of language. This automation replaced the need for third-party intervention, streamlining the workflow and significantly reducing the time required for ticket processing.

Kognitos also helped our client streamline their workflows for more effective management of rewards submissions to improve handling time, run around the clock, reduce fraud, enhance the customer experience, and improve efficiency.
