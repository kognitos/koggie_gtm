# Development | Books | Kognitos Documentation

Have You Completed the Setup?

Ensure you’ve followed all the steps toset upyour project before proceeding. This includes configuring your environment and installing dependencies.

## hashtagProject Structure

The project is organized with the following structure:

#### hashtagRoot Directory

The project root directory is named using the Project Slug(default: sample_book).

#### hashtagSource Code Directory

- 📃 book.py: Contains the core class where your book is defined and implemented.

📃 book.py: Contains the core class where your book is defined and implemented.

- 📁 data: Holds images like🖼️ icon.svg, the default SVG used as a book's icon.

#### hashtagTest Directory

- 📃 test_book.py: Contains unit tests to validate the Book's functionality.

📃 test_book.py: Contains unit tests to validate the Book's functionality.

#### hashtagConfiguration and Dependency Files

- 📃 Dockerfile: Builds the Docker image.

#### hashtagDocumentation

- 📃 README.md: Project overview documentation, including setup and usage instructions.

📃 README.md: Project overview documentation, including setup and usage instructions.

- 📃 USAGE.md: Reference documentation for your Book. This file is not included by default. For details on how to generate it, seeGenerating Documentation.

📃 USAGE.md: Reference documentation for your Book. This file is not included by default. For details on how to generate it, seeGenerating Documentation.

## hashtagImplementation

Implement your book inbook.py.

This class is auto-generated by the Template and serves as the starting point for your Book’s implementation. Use decorators to configure settings, define procedures, and establish API connections. Refer to theAPI Referenceandexample booksarrow-up-rightfor details.

## hashtagManaging Dependencies

Poetryarrow-up-rightis used for Python dependency management in custom book projects. To add an external Python dependency to your project, refer to thepoetry addarrow-up-rightcommand, which adds packages to yourpyproject.tomland installs them.

## hashtagDevelopment Commands

This section outlines essential commands for book development and testing.

#### hashtagFormatting

Code formatting automatically adjusts your code's structure, ensuring adherence to coding standards, readability, and maintainability. To apply the formatting, run:

#### hashtagLinting

Pylintarrow-up-rightis used as the source linter for custom book projects. The linter analyzes and enforce coding standards, checks for errors in Python code, and improves code quality. To run the linter:

#### hashtagGenerating Documentation

This command will generate a comprehensiveUSAGE.mdfile by extracting and formatting thedocstringsfrom your code. To generate the documentation, run:

#### hashtagTesting

Pytestarrow-up-rightis used to test and validate your book. To run the test suite:

## hashtagPackaging with Docker

Build a Docker image to package your book:

Architecture Compatibility

This image pulls theRuntimebase image from Docker Hub, which is currently available only for thelinux/amd64architecture. If you're using a machine with a different architecture, you can use the--platformflag to emulate linux/amd64 when building the image:

## hashtagRunning Your Book Locally

To test your Book in Kognitos before deployment, you can run your Docker image locally withngrokarrow-up-right. Ngrok is a tool that creates a secure tunnel to your local machine and provides a public URL to make your local Docker image accessible from the platform.

1. Install ngrok

Follow the installation steps forngrokarrow-up-rightbased on your system. You will need to sign up for a free account.

2. Obtain your ngrok authtoken

Navigate toYour Authtokenin the ngrok portal and copy your token.

3. Add your authtoken

4. Configure the ngrok api key as an environment variable:

5. Build & run in ngrok mode

This command will invoke a custom script that builds the Docker image and runs it in ngrok mode:

If you are running into issues with `poetry run host`, you canpackageand run your book manually with the following command:

Make sure to replaceauth_token,project_slug, andversionwith your own values.

6. Copy the URL

You'll see the ngrok address in the following format in the logs. Copy the URL:

7. Add the URL to your automation

Copy the URL and paste it into your automation using this syntax:

If you implemented any customconnections, make sure you alsoconnectto your bookafterlearning.
