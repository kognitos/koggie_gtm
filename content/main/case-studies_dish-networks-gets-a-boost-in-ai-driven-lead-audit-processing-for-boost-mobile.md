If you grew up watching satellite TV, chances are that Dish Network made it possible. Headquartered in Englewood, Colorado, Dish Network is known for its satellite television, pay-per-view services, and streaming options through DISH TV and Sling TV. Established in 1980, Dish Network expanded its offerings to include a wide range of entertainment and communication services, including investment in mobile services like Boost Mobile.

Boost Mobile, a subsidiary of Dish Network, focuses on providing affordable prepaid wireless services without annual contracts. Targeting budget-conscious and younger demographics, Boost Mobile offers flexible, no-contract plans with nationwide coverage, leveraging Dish’s infrastructure and network agreements. It provides a range of devices, including the latest smartphones, and maintains a strong retail and online presence to cater to its customer base. Boost Mobile’s operations and focus align with Dish Network’s strategy to penetrate the wireless market and enhance its service portfolio through the development of its own 5G network.

To continue driving profitable growth, Boost Mobile needed an AI solution able to handle its wide-ranging customer complexity, yet approachable and user-friendly enough for its business users to leverage for significant impact. Having tested other automation and RPA solutions just to come up short, Boost Mobile turned to Kognitos’ AI platform to see if it was up to the challenge.

Boost Mobile began their journey with Kognitos by automating Lease Audit Processing. This process has a monthly volume of 2,500+ leases associated with many vendors. Lease Audit documents are extensive, each consisting of several pages and amendments. On average, it takes an experienced team member at least 30 minutes to manually perform a single Lease Audit. Because this labor-intensive process doesn’t scale well, Boost sought out automation opportunities rather than increasing headcountwiththe substantial budget allocation associated with hiring and onboarding.

The automated Lease Audit Process is initiated with an email to Kognitos that contains the associated lease agreement documents. Kognitos extracts relevant information from the agreements based on learnings applied by business users. Then, driven by established business rules and standard operating procedures, Kognitos assesses each agreement, integrating directly with Boost’s systems like LexisNexis and Snowflake. The workflow doesn’t just end with just the assessment, it also generates a summary of the information extracted and forwards this information to the relevant business users. What previously took more than 30 minutes for an individual team member to perform can now be accomplished in less than one minute, and Kognitos is able to run countless number of processes simultaneously in that same timeframe.

With Kognitos, Lease Audit Processing now only requires minimal time for one business user and is a truly scalable solution for continuous growth. Lease Audit Processing time went from an average of 30 to 60 minutes to under one minute per lease, saving 29,500 hours annually. Boost Mobile was able to slash processing time by 97% while also addressing a backlog of over 40,000 leases.

Boost Mobile has been able to create capacity without hiring, driving towards management’s goals of capturing greater market share. As Boost offers services like a 30-day money back guarantee, it is critical to have strong front and back office services, and by leveraging AI, Boost’s employees can spend their time ensuring customers receive the best experience. With a trained team of “Kreators” (Business users equipped to build workflows with Kognitos), Boost is set to expand their AI initiatives and enter a new era of productivity that extends into all areas of the business.
