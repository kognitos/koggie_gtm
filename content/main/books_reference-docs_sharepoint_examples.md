### hashtagOverview

The SharePoint Book supports powerful automation capabilities for working with SharePoint sites, lists, and document libraries. This page provides end-to-end examples demonstrating how to use the Book’s procedures in an automation.

### hashtag📝 Example 1: Employee Feedback Form

This automation demonstrates how to dynamically manage a SharePoint list for collecting employee feedback. It connects to a SharePoint site, creates a new list, adds a new column, and then simulates a form submission by creating a list item.

### hashtag📝 Example 2: Bulk Deletion

This automation example demonstrates how to perform bulk deletion in SharePoint. It creates and populates a list with multiple items. Then, the list is filtered to identify all entries where the "My Col" column is set to "Value 1". These entries are then deleted in bulk, showcasing an efficient method for removing targeted data.
