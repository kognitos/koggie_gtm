# Beyond the Backlog: How AI is Finally Fixing Submissions, Claims, and Onboarding

The insurance industry is saturated with complex processes that have long resisted automation. While many insurtech solutions promise transformation, they often fall short, offering rigid tools or “black box” AI that fails to address core operational challenges. This leaves carriers struggling with fragmented workflows, a lack of transparency, and mounting pressure on their teams with a never-ending backlog. This webinar, presented by Kognitos and Indium, will explore a fundamentally different approach that delivers tangible business outcomes in insurance. We’ll demonstrate how our interpretable and adaptable AI platform moves beyond the limitations of traditional automation to transform the future of insurance operations, including:

- Boost Underwriter Capacity by up to 4x:Free up 60-70% of an underwriter’s day from administrative tasks, increasing daily submission throughput from just 2-3 to 8-10.

- Slash Claim Cycle Times:Reduce claim registration from an average of 7-14 days to mere minutes and cut costly submission error rates by up to 40%.

- Accelerate Agent Onboarding:Transform a multi-week, document-heavy process into a streamlined, automated workflow that gets agents productive faster.

Watch this webinar on-demand to learn how you can reduce the cognitive burden on your teams, eliminate manual work, and achieve meaningful results in the areas that matter most. This session will provide a clear roadmap to leveraging transparent AI for tangible ROI.
