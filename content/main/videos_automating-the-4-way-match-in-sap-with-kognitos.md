# Videos – Automating the 4-Way Match in SAP with Kognitos

Is your procure-to-pay process slowed down by the sheer complexity of manual 4-way matching in SAP? The constant need to verify purchase orders, goods receipts, invoices, and certificates of analysis is a critical, yet painfully inefficient, safeguard against quality failures and fraud. It’s time to move beyond the limitations of traditional automation and empower your team to work smarter, not harder.

Join Kognitos for a live demonstration and discover how to conquer a challenging use case common in manufacturing and supply chain—and any industry reliant on precise procurement verification.

This isn’t about replacing people; it’s about augmenting your existing team with powerful AI that understands your business processes from day one.
