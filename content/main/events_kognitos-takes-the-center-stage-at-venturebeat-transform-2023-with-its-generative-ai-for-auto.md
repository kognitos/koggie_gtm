Binny Gill, our founder and CEO, alongside Biplab Adhya, Managing Partner at Wipro, a leading technology and services company with $11 billion annual revenue, took center stage during a keynote panel discussion to discusswhy learning the language of humans is key to enable generative AI for automation. The panel explored the practical applications of generative AI within enterprise automation processes, drawing in the audience with real-world use cases. During this time, they discussed how Kognitos specializes in leveraging generative AI to automate business tasks and processes, including invoice processing, collection accounting, financial and accounting process automation, center of excellence processes and more.
