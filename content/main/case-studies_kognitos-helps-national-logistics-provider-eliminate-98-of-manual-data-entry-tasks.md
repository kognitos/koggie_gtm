This customer is a comprehensive logistics service provider offering dedicated and regional truckload services, warehousing, brokerage, and maintenance across the United States. The Vice President of Process Improvement & Management (“VP”), has been with the company for over a decade, specializing in analysis and trucking. His primary responsibility is to enhance process efficiencies throughout the organization.

Despite the trucking industry’s slow adoption of new technology, VP recognized the necessity for a more adaptable automation solution. The company had previously utilized robotic process automation (RPA) tools, but their rigidity proved problematic. The logistics sector demands agility, with frequent modifications to workflows being a necessity. Restarting from scratch each time was neither practical nor cost-effective. Therefore, our customer sought a solution that could adapt to the company’s evolving needs seamlessly.

> “We needed to extract data from a customer’s bill of lading. The challenge is that each customer is unique and how their data is recorded on the computer is unique. Kognitos automated the workflows so the BOL can be inserted into the database automatically.”VP of Process Improvement & Management

“We needed to extract data from a customer’s bill of lading. The challenge is that each customer is unique and how their data is recorded on the computer is unique. Kognitos automated the workflows so the BOL can be inserted into the database automatically.”

##### VP of Process Improvement & Management

After extensive research into various RPA tools, VP identified Kognitos as the ideal solution for the company. Kognitos’s cloud-based platform offered easy integration with the company’s diverse operating systems and the flexibility required for their dynamic operations. The primary goal for the company was to automate the extraction of data from customer bills of lading (BOLs) and input this data into their database. Given that each customer has a unique setup, this process presented a significant challenge.

Kognitos developed customized automation workflows integrating directly with Truckmate to manage BOLs, enabling efficient data extraction and database insertion. This automation significantly reduced the manual data entry tasks that previously bogged down the company’s operations. Unlike other business automation platforms, Kognitos’s no-code or low-code environment allowed the company to implement and scale the solution without needing to hire a technical team, making it a perfect fit for their requirements.

> “One of the best parts about Kognitos is that anyone with mid-level technical abilities can use it. Kognitos has a user-friendly interface, and there’s no coding experience required.”VP of Process Improvement & Management

## Business Impact

The implementation of Kognitos brought transformative improvements to the company. By automating repetitive tasks, the company achieved remarkable efficiency gains, including:

- Automation of 100,000 bills of lading

- Significant reduction in manual data entry tasks by 98%

- Halving the staffing requirements for data entry

- Continuous process improvements without the need for frequent restarts

This automation not only streamlined the company’s workflows but also enabled them to manage exception cases more effectively. The flexibility and ease of use of Kognitos’s platform allowed the organization to overcome the limitations of incumbent automation technologies like robotic process automation (RPA) that rely on substantial technical expertise and have high implementation and maintenance costs. The VP is now a proponent of Kognitos, highlighting its benefits to other trucking companies that are hesitant to adopt automation due to the complexities inherent to RPA.

Looking ahead, VP and the company plan to expand its use of Kognitos to other divisions, including accounting and safety, further leveraging the platform’s capabilities to enhance overall operational efficiency.

Automation is essential in the logistics industry, where it enables companies to do more with less. By automating labor-intensive tasks, companies can reduce labor costs while boosting productivity. According to the Deloitte, AI automation solutions like Kognitos outperform traditional RPA in customer experience, accuracy, and analytics.

This customer’s success with Kognitos exemplifies the significant business impact that a well-implemented automation solution can deliver, driving both cost savings and operational improvements.
