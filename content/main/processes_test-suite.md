# Test Suite | Kognitos Documentation

## hashtagOverview

TheTest Suiteempowers you to test and validate any changes made to your processes. After modifying a process, run the Test Suite to compare the new results against expected outcomes. This makes it easy to assess the impact of your changes and ensure everything still works as intended.

### hashtagHow It Works

Test changes made to your processes with this 3-step process:

Create Test Cases

Create test cases from successful process runs. These runs serve as baselines that define the expected behavior and output when a process operates as intended.

Run tests to compare your current process against your test cases. The Test Suite analyzes output to identify changes between your baseline and current version.

Review Changes

Review the test results to check for any differences in expected outcomes.

## hashtagGetting Started

Get started by creating test cases. To do this, you'll need toadd test casesandidentify output.

### hashtag1. Add Test Cases

Atest caseis a process run that serves as the baseline for how a process should perform. Test cases establish the standard against which future runs are compared. They can be added from existing runs directly within the Test Suite or from individual process runs.

- From the left navigation menu, go to theTest Suite.

From the left navigation menu, go to theTest Suite.

### hashtag2. Identify Output

The next step is to define what a successful outcome looks like for your test case. This is done bystarring dataarrow-up-right— highlighting important data elements in a process run. By doing so, you tell the Test Suite which output(ex: total cost, destination, payment status)should be validated to ensure a process runs as expected.

## hashtagRunning Tests

Once you've added test cases and identified output, you're ready to run tests. During atest run, the Test Suite runs the current version of each selected process for every test case. Then, it compares the output generated by the runs against the expected output in your test cases.

### hashtagStarting a Test Run

Follow these steps to start a test run:

Navigate to the Test Suite

From the left navigation menu, go to theTest Suite.

In the Test Suite, selectRun Tests.

Select Processes

ARun Testspop-up will appear, displaying a list of processes to select from:

- Ready for Testing:At the top of the list, you'll see processes that are ready for testing.Alleligible processes are selected by default. You can uncheck processes to exclude them from the test run.

- Ineligible for Testing: At the bottom of the list, you'll find processes that cannot be tested yet. These will be categorized as eitherMissing Test CasesorMissing Outputs. You cannot select these processes until you'veadded test casesoridentified outputfor them.

Note: The latest version of each process will be selected, ensuring you're always testing against the most recent version.

Confirm Test Run

Confirm the test run by clicking onRun Tests.

Run Tests for a Single Process

You can also run tests for anindividual processdirectly.

Click on a process within the Test Suite, then selectRun Process Tests.

### hashtagStopping a Test Run

To stop a test run in progress, clickStop Test Runon theTest Runpage.

## hashtagReviewing Test Run Results

All your test runs are summarized in theTest Runstab of the Test Suite. Access the results of a specific test run by clicking on it from this overview page.

### hashtagOverview

Here's a visual guide to reviewing your test run results:

### hashtagTest Run Metrics

Displayed at the top of aTest Runare the following metrics:

- Passed Runs: The number of runs where all the output matches the expected results.

Passed Runs: The number of runs where all the output matches the expected results.

- Failed Runs: The number of runs where one or more outputs doesnotmatch the expected results.

Failed Runs: The number of runs where one or more outputs doesnotmatch the expected results.

- Guidance Required: The number of runs that paused during execution and required user guidance to proceed. These runs are neither passed nor failed until guidance is provided.

- Skipped Runs: The number of runs that were not executed or skipped.

Skipped Runs: The number of runs that were not executed or skipped.

By default, these metrics are displayed for theentire run. You can click into a process to update the metrics for thatspecific process.

### hashtagProcess Breakdown

Below the overall summary on theTest Runpage is a list ofprocessesincluded in the test run. For each process, you can see a summary of the overall status, pass percentage, and run metrics. Click into a process to drill down into individual test cases.

### hashtagTest Case Breakdown

Once you've clicked into an individual process within a test run, you'll see a breakdown bytest case. Click on any test case to view a side-by-side comparison between theexpected outputand the test runoutput.

## hashtagAddressing Test Failures

Test failures generally occur in one of the following scenarios:

### hashtagOutput Mismatch

The test fails because theexpected output doesn't match the current outputfrom your process. To address this issue, you need to analyze the discrepancy and ask:is the new output correct?

- Ifno, there is an issue with your process. Fix the automation logic causing the incorrect result.

Ifno, there is an issue with your process. Fix the automation logic causing the incorrect result.

- Ifyes, the test case is outdated. Remove the test case and add a new one that contains the updated output.

Ifyes, the test case is outdated. Remove the test case and add a new one that contains the updated output.

### hashtagOutput Not Found

Theexpected output is missingentirely, pointing to an issue with the process itself. To address this, update your process to ensure it generates the expected output. This involves debugging your automation workflow and logic to understand why the data isn't being generated.

Note: If you modify the line in the automation where the output was marked, the test may not be able to find the expected output.

## hashtagRemoving Test Cases

Remove invalid or outdated test cases from your Test Suite to keep it up-to-date. Test cases can be removed directly from the Test Suite or from process runs.
