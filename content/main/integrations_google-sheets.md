Kognitos & Google Sheets: Automate data entry or analysis tasks using simple natural language commands to save time while improving accuracy in spreadsheets.

Kognitos is a leading US-based artificial intelligence platform designed to transform how businesses operate by automating repetitive tasks and enhancing efficiency. Our AI automation platform allows users to automate complex business processes simply by communicating their goals in plain English. Leveraging advanced technologies like a proprietary LLM-based interpreter, Intelligent Document Processing (IDP), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Natural Language Processing (NLP), Kognitos enhances productivity, speed, and accuracy. Unlike traditional automation solutions that require complex coding, Kognitos offers unparalleled adaptability and scalability, empowering businesses to streamline workflows and eliminate manual tasks without extensive technical knowledge.

Security is a core principle of Kognitos’ architecture, built on state-of-the-art cloud services with strong security foundations. Critical business processes run on the Kognitos platform, and we prioritize the security of both the processes and their data.

Kognitos employs serverless, cloud-based services with the principle of least privilege access. For example, a service without a need to access a database does not have access to it.

Kognitos has achieved the SOC 2 Type II certification for our best-in-class security controls and compliance with the AICPA’s Trust Services Criteria.Learn more
