# Creating Salesforce Reports | Books | Kognitos Documentation

Creating a report in Salesforce involves selecting the type of report, defining the criteria, and choosing the fields to display. With Kognitos, you can articulate these requirements in a more intuitive manner. For instance, you can specify the type of report you need, the records it should cover, and any specific conditions that must be met.

This tells Kognitos to create a Salesforce report for opportunities from the last quarter, including specific fields. Kognitos translates this into the appropriate Salesforce report creation process, selecting the correct report type and applying the specified filters.
