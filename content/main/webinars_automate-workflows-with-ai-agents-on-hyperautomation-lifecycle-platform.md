# Webinars – Automate Workflows with AI Agents on Hyperautomation Lifecycle Platform

This session explores the future of intelligent automation: hyperautomation within the framework of agentic process automation. Kognitos is redefining this space with its Hyperautomation Lifecycle (HAL) platform that integrates cutting-edge technologies into one streamlined system.

HAL serves as an all-in-one platform that achieves end-to-end business process automation without the headaches of legacy solutions like RPA and IDP. Learn how HAL’s innovative features—Auto Write, Auto Test, Auto Deploy, Auto Monitor, and Auto Debug—simplify automation, reduce costs, and eliminate the need for complex infrastructure.

- Incumbent Automation:Explore the evolution of automation over the past two decades, from RPA to intelligent automationIntroduction to Agentic AI and Hyperautomation:Agentic AI represents a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, utilizing techniques like LLMs, ML, and deep learning to create autonomous agents capable of analyzing data, making informed decisions, and acting independently. Learn how HAL addresses the entire lifecycle of process automation with AI Agents.Integration with Agentic AI:Understand how HAL operates within an agentic AI framework to enable autonomous, adaptive systems with near-human problem-solving capabilities.Live Demonstration:Catch HAL in action during a live demo. Check out the advanced capabilities—Auto Write, Auto Test, Auto Deploy, Auto Monitor, and Auto Debug—that simplify automation, reduce costs, and eliminate complex infrastructure.Q&A Session:Open floor for attendees to ask questions.
