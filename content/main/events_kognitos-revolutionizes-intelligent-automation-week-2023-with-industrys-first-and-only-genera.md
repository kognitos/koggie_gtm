At the2023 Intelligent Automation Week, Kognitos took over the narrative as the pioneering and sole provider of a Generative AI solution tailored specifically for enterprise automation. The Kognitos team had an incredible time connecting with visionaries and clients during the remarkable event.

During this valuable time, we saw that enterprises face a multitude of process automation possibilities spanning across finance, customer service, IT management, BPO, supply chain, and beyond. Recognizing generative AI as the future of intelligent automation, numerous service providers are becoming interested in forming partnerships with Kognitos. As the interest in the potential that Kognitos offers to these companies continues to grow, the initial step is to provide them with education and insights. Numerous enterprises are at the forefront of embracing generative AI technologies, beginning to develop private Large Language Models (LLMs) and customizing AI models to cater to their industry and function-specific use cases.

In the field of automation, there are various point solution providers that exist, offering specialized services such as document processing, process and workflow builders, process mining, and more. However, Kognitos stands apart as the exclusive solution constructed entirely upon the foundation of generative AI. By leveraging the power of this revolutionary technology, Kognitos pushes beyond the limitations of traditional automation, empowering enterprises to achieve a new level of efficiency, innovation, and scalability.

We are looking forward to many more events that bring us together with like-minded businesses and leaders that will continue to inspire the growth of our company!
